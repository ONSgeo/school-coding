# Making a Map in R


## Introduction
This repository contains the supporting documents, code and data for the ONS Online Showcase event on Coding. 

This code shows you how to complete a simple piece of data analysis in R and then make a map.

You can use this code as a starting point to practice coding and learn about R - please feel free to use and adapt it to make it useful to you.

## Getting Started with R
To get started with R you need to [download R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [R studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and install them both on your computer. 

This [R programming for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvKETZ6kr9Q) video will show you how to use R in RStudio. 

If you want to run the script provided here then:
 * create a new project in R studio
 * download a copy of "school-coding-example.R" and the data folder from this repository and move it into your R project's directory
 * open "school-coding-example.R"
 * put your cursor on a line and press ctrl+enter on your keyboard to run the line (start at the top and work down the script!)
 * remember that lines starting with a # are comments and are not code - they are notes to help you understand what the code does
